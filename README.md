The dataset used for this work is taken from the official website of the National Statistical Institute (ISTAT).
For each region of Italy and autonomous province, a sample of 100 families with the same characteristics was considered, each of which expressed an opinion about:

<ul>
  <li>The difficulty in finding parking;</li>
  <li>The difficulty of connecting with public transport;</li>
  <li>Traffic;</li>
  <li>Poor street lighting;</li>
  <li>Poor road conditions.</li>
</ul>

The constructed dataset reports, for each region, the number of families that have expressed a very high degree of dissatisfaction, regarding the aspects listed above; it is possible to interpret the value of each cell of the dataset as a percentage.

This experiment was conducted both in 2018 and in 2019, seeing the production of two different datasets. The statistical analysis was conducted on the dataset for the year 2019, while the dataset for the year 2018 was considered only to compare it with the dataset for the year 2019. 

Descriptive statistics techniques were used, in particular:
<ul>
  <li>Data visualization;</li>
  <li>Univariate statistical analysis;</li>
  <li>Bivariate statistical analysis;</li>
  <li>Cluster analysis.</li>
</ul>
